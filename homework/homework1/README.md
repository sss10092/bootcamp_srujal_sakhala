# Portfolio Optimization Project
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
The problem we aim to address is the challenge of optimizing a diversified investment portfolio under fluctuating market conditions while managing risk exposure. Poor portfolio allocation can lead to suboptimal returns or excessive risk, impacting institutional investors and fund managers. By analyzing historical and current market data, we aim to identify patterns, forecast risks, and recommend optimal allocations.

## Stakeholder & User
Primary stakeholders include portfolio managers and institutional investors who make allocation decisions. End users include financial analysts and risk management teams who require actionable insights to adjust portfolio holdings. Outputs are typically used during portfolio review cycles and investment strategy meetings.

## Useful Answer & Decision
The project will provide both **descriptive and predictive outputs**:
- **Descriptive:** Patterns, correlations, and trends among asset classes.
- **Predictive:** Forecasted returns, portfolio risk metrics (VaR, Sharpe ratio), and optimized allocation weights.  
The artifact delivered will include Jupyter notebooks, cleaned datasets, Python scripts, and visual dashboards.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Historical market and financial data are available and reliable.  
- Computation can be performed within local or cloud resources.  
- Portfolio constraints (e.g., regulatory limits, risk limits) must be respected.  
- Model latency is acceptable for strategic, not high-frequency, decisions.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Future market conditions are uncertain; models may underperform during extreme events.  
- Correlation between assets may change over time.  
- Data quality issues (missing or erroneous values) may affect outputs.  
- Risk mitigation: Backtesting, sensitivity analysis, and scenario testing.

## Lifecycle Mapping
Goal → Stage → Deliverable
- Optimize portfolio returns → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → README.md with project scoping  
- Analyze historical trends → Data Analysis & Modeling (Stage 02) → Jupyter notebooks and visualizations  
- Forecast portfolio risk → Predictive Modeling (Stage 03) → Risk metrics and allocation recommendations  
- Communicate insights → Reporting & Documentation (Stage 04) → Dashboards and PDF report

## Repo Plan
Folders: /data/, /src/, /notebooks/, /docs/  
Cadence for updates: Weekly commits for notebooks, scripts, and documentation; milestone commits at each stage.
